Replaces the default virtual robots.txt generated by WordPress with an editable one, and deletes any physical robots.txt file that may already exist.

== Description ==

**Replaces the default virtual robots.txt generated by WordPress with an editable one, and deletes any physical robots.txt file that may already exist.**

Virtual Robots.txt is a simple WordPress plugin for easily editing the robots.txt content on your website. Because the goal of any CMS is to be as self-contained as possible, and because WordPress itself contains a default "virtual" robots.txt file generated by the `wp_options` table, it makes sense to maintain a virtual robots.txt whenever possible to make site management and migration more controlled.

Instead of simply using the built-in robots_txt filter, however, this plugin creates a new hook for the main parse_query action to ensure that no other WordPress plugin (or theme) can alter the contents of robots.txt after it has been edited. Although the current version does not directly "disable" the robots_txt filter, in effect that filter is completely ignored by ending the hook sequence before robots_txt can be called.

Unlike similar plugins (or WordPress itself), it includes a default "allow all" ruleset upon activation. The theory behind this is that playing things safe is always the best course of action for inexperienced webmasters; allowing all robots to access all site content is not only recommended by Google but also makes sense in the vast majority of cases. While the form value will persist on plugin deactivation, the option value will be completely deleted in the case of the plugin being removed from your site, in an effort at clean code and to avoid any confusion or conflicts.

The plugin disables 100% the robots_txt filter because stops execution before this filter is triggered. It uses a very early hook "parse_query" that contains the context and, for a /robots.txt request, echoes the form content and ends execution of PHP.

The normal load sequence for `/robots.txt` requests:

    1. (load plugin hooks)
    2. init
    3. wp
    4. parse_query
    5. template_redirect
    6. robots_txt <- filter

When using this plugin, the sequence changes:

    1. (load plugin hooks)
    2. init
    3. wp
    4. parse_query <- detect context via WP is_robots method, show the form content and ends execution.

### Compatibility

* Meant for Linux servers
* Apache works automatically, Nginx requires try_files rule (see FAQ)
* Minimum PHP version: 5.5
* Designed for: PHP 7+ and MySQL 5.7+
* Can be used as a "Must Use" plugin (mu-plugins)

### Roadmap

* Localization (translation support)
* Hook/filter/sequence experimentation
* Option to switch between Virtual and Physical robots.txt
* More features (based on user suggestions)
* Code maintenance/improvements

### Inspiration

* [WordPress Robots.txt File](https://wordpress.org/plugins/robots-txt-file/)

### Disclaimer

*We released this plugin in response to our managed hosting clients asking for better access to their server environment, and our primary goal will likely remain supporting that purpose. Although we are 100% open to considering requests from the WordPress community, we kindly ask that you keep the above goals in mind before leaving reviews of this plugin.*


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/virtual-robotstxt-littlebizzy`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Check your WP Admin dashboard (admin users only) and footer area to view the statistics
4. For Apache servers, it should work aotomatically
5. For Nginx servers (without Apache in front) make sure try_files sends requests to your PHP processor:

    location = /robots.txt {
		try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
        allow all;
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
    }


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin replace the need for my physical robots.txt file? =

Yes. Currently its a totally virtual robots.txt solution that will "delete" any physical robots.txt that exists. The reason for this is to make WordPress as self-contained as possible, and since there is no real downside to managing robots.txt in such a virtual fashion. In future versions, we may create the option to switch between either a virtual or physical file, but for now its totally virtual as explained.

= Does this plugin edit a physical robots.txt or only store a virtual robots.txt content? =

This plugin will NOT edit a physical robots.txt file and only offers a virtual robots.txt content via the wp_options table.

= How can I change this plugin's settings? =

Under the Settings menu on the left hand site, a new link is generated called Robots.txt

= Are there any performance drawbacks to using this plugin? =

Absolutely not. All wp_options are cached by default in WordPress and loaded prior to other data. In a theoretical world, a physical robots.txt file may in fact load more quickly, but all purposes both humans and robots wouldn't notice a difference when using a virtual file. Please note that if you are using CloudFlare or other special cache systems, you may need to clear those to see your robots.txt update correctly. However, traditional caches such as page cache plugins or oboject caching (i.e. Memcached or Redis) should not effect the content of this plugin.

= I'm using Nginx and this plugin is not working? =

Make sure you are sending requests for the static file robots.txt via your PHP proessor such as PHP-FPM:

    location = /robots.txt {
		try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
        allow all;
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
    }

= I have a suggestion, how can I let you know? =

Please avoid leaving negative reviews in order to get a feature implemented. Instead, we kindly ask that you post your feedback on the wordpress.org support forums by tagging this plugin in your post. If needed, you may also contact our homepage.
